# So Long for 42cursus

This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make us work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements. 
The goal is to improve our skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

We are using the school graphical library Minilibx that includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with
keyboard and mouse events.

The game is about a character that needs to collect all the collectibles on the map before escaping.
